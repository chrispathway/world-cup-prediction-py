# 2026 World Cup Prediction (Live)

A Python CLI that predicts the 2026 FIFA World Cup with a **Dixon-Coles** goal
model fitted on the last decade of international results.

It gives every team an **attack** and a **defence** rating, models a match as
two coupled goal distributions (with the Dixon-Coles low-score correction that
properly handles draws and 0-0 / 1-1 games), and runs a **Monte Carlo**
simulation of the full 48-team tournament (10,000 runs by default) to estimate
every team's odds of winning the title, reaching the final, and reaching the
semis.

## Live scorecard — model vs reality

Every 2026 World Cup match played so far, scored against the model. The model
was trained **only on data from before the tournament**, so each of these is a
genuine out-of-sample prediction. **Model prediction** shows the most likely
outcome with the home-win / draw / away-win probabilities (%); **Result** is a
✅ when the model's most likely outcome matched the actual winner (or a draw),
❌ otherwise. Knockout ties are scored on the 90-minute result, so a game level
after 90 counts as a draw regardless of who won the shootout.

**Outcome accuracy: 72 / 103 = 69.9%** correct calls, covering every match of
the tournament played so far.

## Requirements

Python 3.10+ and a couple of scientific packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt   # numpy, scipy, certifi
```

## Run

```bash
python oracle.py                 # fit the model, simulate, then the prompt
python oracle.py --sims 2000     # fewer simulations = faster, a bit noisier
```

On first run it downloads the historical results dataset and caches it locally
(`.cache_results.csv`); later runs are offline. Delete that file to refresh.

### Backtest + final prediction

```bash
python evaluate_2026.py
```

This scores the model out-of-sample against every 2026 World Cup match already
played (accuracy, log-loss, Brier).

## The model in brief

- **Recency weighting.** Each training match is weighted by an exponential
  time-decay with a ~3-year half-life, so last year's results count far more
  than results from ten years ago.
- **Competition weighting.** Competitive fixtures (World Cups, continental
  championships, qualifiers) outweigh friendlies.
- **Dixon-Coles goals.** For home team *i* vs away team *j*, expected goals are
  `λ = exp(attack_i − defence_j + home_adv)` and `μ = exp(attack_j − defence_i)`.
  The joint scoreline probability is `τ(x,y) · Poisson(x;λ) · Poisson(y;μ)`,
  where `τ` (governed by a single dependence parameter `ρ`) corrects the four
  lowest scorelines — fixing plain Poisson's habit of under-predicting draws.
- **Joint fit.** All attack/defence ratings, the home advantage and `ρ` are
  estimated *together* by maximising the weighted log-likelihood (L-BFGS-B with
  an analytic gradient).
- **Neutral knockouts.** World Cup matches are simulated on neutral ground, so
  neither side gets the home-advantage term.
- **Tournament.** 12 groups of 4 play round-robin; the top two of each group
  plus the eight best third-place teams advance to a 32-team knockout bracket.
  The bracket uses a **fixed template** that follows the real format — group
  winners are protected from each other in the Round of 32, and a group's winner
  and runner-up sit in opposite halves so they can only meet again in the final.
  Knockout ties are decided by a lightly strength-weighted shootout. Repeat
  10,000 times and count how often each team reaches each stage.

## Using the prompt

```
> Brazil vs France      # head-to-head match prediction
> titles                # reprint the full title-odds table
> teams                 # list all 48 qualified teams + groups
> quit
```

Team names are matched loosely — `Brazil`, `BRA`, or `bra` all work.

## How it works

| File | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `dataset.py` | Downloads results, restricts them to the training window, and computes the recency + competition weights. |
| `dixon_coles.py` | The Dixon-Coles goal model: weighted maximum-likelihood fit, scoreline grid, sampling. |
| `simulation.py` | Monte Carlo group stage and knockout bracket, driven by the fitted model. |
| `worldcup2026.py` | The 48 qualified teams, group assignments, and dataset name mapping. |
| `oracle.py` | The CLI — wires it together and renders the tables / prompt. |
| `evaluate_2026.py` | Out-of-sample backtest against played 2026 matches + Round-of-16 predictions. |
